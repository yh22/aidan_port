As long as the claim conditions are triggered, the policy automatically pays compensation and the claim amount is paid. The fact that the data in the block chain is real and difficult to tamper with can effectively simplify the processing of insurance claims, reduce processing costs, and reduce the probability of claim fraud. In addition, through the blockchain technology, the digital management of personal data and simplified information authentication help to more clearly disclose the historical situation.';
